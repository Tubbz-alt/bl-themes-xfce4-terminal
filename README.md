# bl-themes-xfce4-terminal

These are the color schemes from the [Hydrogen and Helium themes from BunsenLabs Linux](https://github.com/BunsenLabs/bunsen-themes), adapted for the Xfce terminal.

To install, copy the theme files to `~/.local/share/xfce4/terminal/colorschemes`.

I've only tested this on BunsenLabs, but I suspect that the themes should work everywhere you can install `xfce4-terminal`.
