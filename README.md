# bl-themes-xfce4-terminal

These are the color schemes from the [Hydrogen](https://github.com/BunsenLabs/bunsen-themes/tree/hydrogen) and [Helium themes from BunsenLabs Linux](https://github.com/BunsenLabs/bunsen-themes), adapted for the Xfce terminal.

### Installation

To install, copy [helium.theme](https://github.com/nflorin/bl-themes-xfce4-terminal/blob/master/helium.theme) and/or [hydrogen.theme](https://github.com/nflorin/bl-themes-xfce4-terminal/blob/master/helium.theme) to `~/.local/share/xfce4/terminal/colorschemes`. Create the folder if it doesn't already exist.

Then in `xfce4-terminal`, click on the *Edit* menu and choose *Preferences*. Go to the *Colors* tab, and in the drop down menu under *Presets* select "Helium" or "Hydrogen".

### Notes

I've only tested this on BunsenLabs Helium and on Ubuntu 18.04 running on top of Windows 10 (with WSL 2 and VcXsrv), but I suspect that the color schemes should work everywhere you can install `xfce4-terminal`. It's worth noting that these are only color schemes, and not full themes.
